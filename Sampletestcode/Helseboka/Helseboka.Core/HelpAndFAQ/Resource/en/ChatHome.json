    "description": "Via Helseboka you can get medical advice from your doctor. Regular inquiries are questions about illness and ailments the doctor knows that you have, as well as questions about symptoms, medications and side effects. You may request a prescription, certificate or sick leave for medical issues already known to your doctor. Note that if the request requires the physician to make a medical assessment, you must pay for this in line with a normal appointment (see «How much does it cost?»).\n\nVia Helseboka you can also get answers to practical questions, find out if lab-test reports have come and ask for something else that does not require a medical assessment. Such requests are usually answered by health secretaries at the doctor's office. \n\nNB: Medical chat should not be used in emergency situations. If you need quick medical assistance during the day, please call the doctor's office. Outside the doctor's office hours, call the emergency room for immediate help 24 hours a day. In case of severe acute illness or injury, call emergency number 113."

    "description": "Chat with a doctor or health secretary who does not require medical assessment will be free for you. Your doctor will in each case consider whether the dialogue is considered a paid consultation charged with your usual deductible and billing order (until you receive a free card). \n\nThe invoice is issued by the medical office after the chat. \n\n Helsenorge.no provides a pricelist summary of common interests of a doctor here: https://helsenorge.no/payment-for-helpcare/payment-payment \n\nYou may not pay a fee to Helseboka to use the service."
